{"name":"Slurm","tagline":"Slurm: A Highly Scalable Workload Manager","body":"Slurm Workload Manager\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis is the Slurm Workload Manager. Slurm\r\nis an open-source cluster resource management and job scheduling system\r\nthat strives to be simple, scalable, portable, fault-tolerant, and\r\ninterconnect agnostic. Slurm currently has been tested only under Linux.\r\n\r\nAs a cluster resource manager, Slurm provides three key functions. First,\r\nit allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive access to resources\r\n(compute nodes) to users for some duration of time so they can perform\r\nwork. Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and\r\nmonitoring work (normally a parallel job) on the set of allocated\r\nnodes. Finally, it arbitrates conflicting requests for resources by\r\nmanaging a queue of pending work.\r\n\r\nSlurm is provided \"as is\" and with no warranty. This software is\r\ndistributed under the GNU General Public License, please see the files\r\nCOPYING, DISCLAIMER, and LICENSE.OpenSSL for details.\r\n\r\nThis README presents an introduction to compiling, installing, and\r\nusing Slurm.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCE DISTRIBUTION HIERARCHY\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nThe top-level distribution directory contains this README as well as\r\nother high-level documentation files, and the scripts used to configure\r\nand build Slurm (see INSTALL). Subdirectories contain the source-code\r\nfor Slurm as well as a DejaGNU test suite and further documentation. A\r\nquick description of the subdirectories of the Slurm distribution follows:\r\n\r\n  src/        [ Slurm source ]\r\n     Slurm source code is further organized into self explanatory\r\n     subdirectories such as src/api, src/slurmctld, etc.\r\n\r\n  doc/        [ Slurm documentation ]\r\n     The documentation directory contains some latex, html, and ascii\r\n     text papers, READMEs, and guides. Manual pages for the Slurm\r\n     commands and configuration files are also under the doc/ directory.\r\n\r\n  etc/        [ Slurm configuration ]\r\n     The etc/ directory contains a sample config file, as well as\r\n     some scripts useful for running Slurm.\r\n\r\n  slurm/      [ Slurm include files ]\r\n     This directory contains installed include files, such as slurm.h\r\n     and slurm_errno.h, needed for compiling against the Slurm API.\r\n\r\n  testsuite/  [ Slurm test suite ]\r\n     The testsuite directory contains the framework for a set of\r\n     DejaGNU and \"make check\" type tests for Slurm components.\r\n     There is also an extensive collection of Expect scripts.\r\n\r\n  auxdir/     [ autotools directory ]\r\n     Directory for autotools scripts and files used to configure and\r\n     build Slurm\r\n\r\n  contribs/   [ helpful tools outside of Slurm proper ]\r\n     Directory for anything that is outside of slurm proper such as a\r\n     different api or such.  To have this build you need to do a\r\n     make contrib/install-contrib.\r\n\r\nCOMPILING AND INSTALLING THE DISTRIBUTION\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nPlease see the instructions at\r\n  http://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart_admin.html\r\n\r\nExtensive documentation is available from our home page at\r\n  http://slurm.schedmd.com/\r\n\r\nPROBLEMS\r\n--------\r\n\r\nIf you experience problems compiling, installing, or running Slurm, see\r\n   http://slurm.schedmd.com/help.html\r\n","google":"UA-47927131-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
